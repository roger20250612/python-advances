"""Flyweight Design Pattern

üß† What is the Flyweight Design Pattern?
The Flyweight design pattern is a software design pattern that allows you to reduce the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.

üí° Purpose:
    Reduce the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
    Improve performance by reusing existing objects.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
    It improves performance by reusing existing objects.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

üß± Flyweight Pattern Structure:
    Flyweight ‚Äì Represents a flyweight object.
    Concrete Flyweight ‚Äì Represents a flyweight object.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the flyweight to represent a flyweight object.

üéØ Scenario
Imagine a text editor rendering millions of characters.
Instead of storing font style, size, and color for each character, we store it once per style, and just reuse it.

üß† Key Takeaways
    Flyweight (TextStyle): stores shared, immutable data.
    Factory: reuses existing flyweights instead of creating new ones.
    Extrinsic state (Character.symbol): kept outside to remain unique.
