🧠 What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.

💡 Purpose:
    Select an algorithm at runtime.
    Allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.

🎯 Why use it?
✅ Advantages:
    It selects an algorithm at runtime.
    It allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

⚙️ How does it work?
    The Strategy design pattern allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

🧱 Strategy Pattern Structure:
    Strategy – Selects an algorithm at runtime.
    Concrete Strategy – Selects an algorithm at runtime.
    Client – Uses the strategy to select an algorithm at runtime.

🎯 Scenario
We simulate a payment system where the user can pay with a credit card or a bank transfer.

🧩 Key Benefits:
    Selects the algorithm at runtime.
    Allows you to change the algorithm without modifying the client code.
