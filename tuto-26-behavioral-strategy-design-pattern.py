"""Strategy Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy

üß† What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.

üí° Purpose:
    Select an algorithm at runtime.
    Allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It selects an algorithm at runtime.
    It allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The Strategy design pattern allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

üß± Strategy Pattern Structure:
    Strategy ‚Äì Selects an algorithm at runtime.
    Concrete Strategy ‚Äì Selects an algorithm at runtime.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the strategy to select an algorithm at runtime.

üéØ Scenario
We simulate a payment system where the user can pay with a credit card or a bank transfer.

Suppose you‚Äôre building a payment processing system that supports multiple payment methods: Credit Card, PayPal, and Bitcoin.
Instead of hardcoding logic for each, you define them as interchangeable strategies.

üß© Key Benefits:
    Selects the algorithm at runtime.
    Allows you to change the algorithm without modifying the client code.

    Strategy interface (PaymentStrategy): defines the common interface.
    Concrete strategies implement different algorithms.
    Context (PaymentContext) delegates work to the strategy object.
    Flexibility: You can switch strategies at runtime without modifying the context.
