"""Template Method Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method

üß† What is the Template Method Design Pattern?
The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

üí° Purpose:
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    It allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The Template Method design pattern allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

üß± Template Method Pattern Structure:
    Template Method ‚Äì Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Concrete Template Method ‚Äì Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the template method to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

üéØ Scenario
We simulate a base class that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building a data mining framework that reads data from different file formats (CSV, JSON, XML). The high-level steps are the same: open file ‚Üí parse data ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí close file, but each file format parses data differently.

üß© Key Benefits:
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
