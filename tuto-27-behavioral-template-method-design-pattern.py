🧠 What is the Template Method Design Pattern?
The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

💡 Purpose:
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

🎯 Why use it?
✅ Advantages:
    It defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    It allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

⚙️ How does it work?

🧱 Template Method Pattern Structure:
    Template Method – Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Concrete Template Method – Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Client – Uses the template method to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

🎯 Scenario
We simulate a base class that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

🧩 Key Benefits:
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    Allows you to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, and let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
