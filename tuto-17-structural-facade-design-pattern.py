"""Facade Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade

üß† What is the Facade Design Pattern?
The Facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

üí° Purpose:
    Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
    Simplifies the interaction with the subsystem by hiding its complexity.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
    It simplifies the interaction with the subsystem by hiding its complexity.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The Facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
    It simplifies the interaction with the subsystem by hiding its complexity.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

üß± Facade Pattern Structure:
    Facade ‚Äì Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
    Subsystem ‚Äì The complex subsystem.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the facade to interact with the subsystem.

üéØ Scenario
You have a complex home theater system with multiple subsystems: DVDPlayer, Projector, Amplifier, and Lights.
Using the Facade pattern, you create a single HomeTheaterFacade class to simplify usage.

üß† Benefits Demonstrated
    Simplified interaction: The client only needs to deal with the HomeTheaterFacade.
    Decouples the client from subsystem complexity.
    Subsystems can still be used independently if necessary.
