"""Mediator Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator

üß† What is the Mediator Design Pattern?
The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

üí° Purpose:
    Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    Allows you to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    It allows you to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The Mediator design pattern allows you to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    It allows you to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

üß± Mediator Pattern Structure:
    Mediator ‚Äì Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    Concrete Mediator ‚Äì Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the mediator to define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.

üéØ Scenario
We simulate a Chat Room where multiple users communicate only through a central mediator, not directly with each other.

üß© Key Benefits:
    Loose coupling: Objects communicate through the mediator, not directly.
    Central control: Easy to modify or manage interactions in one place.
    Scalability: Adding new objects doesn't increase complexity exponentially.

# Demo 02 - Mediator as a Message Broker
# A MessageBroker-style communication is a classic use of the Mediator pattern, often found in systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or event buses.
# Here‚Äôs a Python implementation of a lightweight Message Broker that allows components to subscribe to and publish messages to topics, without directly referencing each other.

# üß© Key Takeaways:
#     Loose coupling: Publishers don't know or care who listens.
#     Dynamic subscription: Subscribers can join/leave topics anytime.
#     Scalable: Easily handles many topics and subscribers.
