https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor

🧠 What is the Visitor Design Pattern?
The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a new operation
without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.

💡 Purpose:
    Defines a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    Allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.

🎯 Why use it?
✅ Advantages:
    It defines a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    It allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

⚙️ How does it work?
    The Visitor design pattern allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    It allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.

    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

🧱 Visitor Pattern Structure:
    Visitor – Defines a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    Concrete Visitor – Defines a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
    Client – Uses the visitor to define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.

🎯 Scenario
We simulate a weather station that monitors temperature and humidity. When the temperature or humidity changes, the weather station notifies all its observers.

🧩 Key Benefits:
    Notifies all dependents automatically.
    Enables decoupling of objects.
