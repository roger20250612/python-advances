"""üå≥ Composite Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite

üß† What is the Composite Design Pattern?
The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object.

üí° Purpose:
    Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
    Treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object.
    It provides a way to manage complex relationships between objects.
    It can be used to represent hierarchical structures, trees, or graphs.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The Composite design pattern allows you to treat a group of objects as a single object.
    It provides a way to manage complex relationships between objects.
    It can be used to represent hierarchical structures, trees, or graphs.

        print(" " * indent + f"+ Folder: {self.name}")
        for child in self._children:
            child.show(indent + 2)

# Usage
root = Folder("root")
home = Folder("home")
documents = Folder("documents")
pictures = Folder("pictures")

file1 = File("resume.pdf")
file2 = File("photo.jpg")
file3 = File("todo.txt")

documents.add(file1)
pictures.add(file2)
home.add(documents)
home.add(pictures)
root.add(home)
root.add(file3)

root.show()

# $ python tuto-10-composite-design-pattern.py
# + Folder: root
#   + Folder: home

"""
üß† Explanation:
    FileSystemItem: Abstract base class for both files (leaf) and folders (composites).
    File: A leaf node, can't contain other items.
    Folder: A composite, can contain files or other folders.
    The .show() method demonstrates the uniform treatment of both files and folders‚Äîrecursive tree traversal.

‚úÖ Benefits:
    Simplifies client code by treating individual items and groups uniformly.
    Naturally models hierarchical structures (e.g., GUI trees, company org charts).

üîê Why Use This Version?
    It's clean, reusable, and thread-safe in most single-threaded applications.
