"""State Design Pattern

https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state

üß† What is the State Design Pattern?
The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to associate a context with an object in a way that
it can vary independently from other objects.

The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior dynamically when its internal state changes. It encapsulates different behaviors for different states in separate state classes, and delegates to the current state object.

üí° Purpose:
    Associates a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    Allows you to associate a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.

üéØ Why use it?
‚úÖ Advantages:
    It associates a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    It allows you to associate a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?
    The State design pattern allows you to associate a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    It allows you to associate a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    It promotes the Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification.
    It enables you to change the internal implementation of the subsystem without affecting the client code.

üß± State Pattern Structure:
    State ‚Äì Associates a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    Concrete State ‚Äì Associates a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.
    Client ‚Äì Uses the state to associate a context with an object in a way that it can vary independently from other objects.

üéØ Scenario
We‚Äôll model a Document Editor with three states:
    DraftState: Content can be edited.
    ModerationState: Content is pending review.
    PublishedState: Content is read-only.

üß© Key Benefits:
    Notifies all dependents automatically.
    Enables decoupling of objects.

‚úÖ Key Points:
    Document delegates behavior to its current State.
    You can add/remove states easily without changing Document.
    Behavior changes at runtime depending on state.
